# Gravity-Forms-Address-Dropdowns-AddOn
Create state and province dropdowns for International address fields in Gravity Forms.

Prevent users from typing in incorrect variations of states or provinces. Important for proper lead tracking in some cases.

This plugin does not replace the text field that Gravity Forms uses for International addresses. Instead it populates the existing free text field with the value from generated state and province dropdowns. It hides
the free text field when the current country is US or Canada and display it for other countries.
